\begin{rSection}{Research Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}{2017 - Present}{Research Assistant, Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles}{Urbana, IL}
\item Advisor: Professor Kathryn D. Huff
\item Developing and applying \textsc{Cyclus}, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator, for the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle
\item Running simulations to model varying transfer and loading strategies for moving of spent nuclear fuel from reactor sites to a final waste repository
\item Development of demand-driven deployment algorithms for \textsc{Cyclus} 
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Queen's University at Kingston}{2016 - 2017}{Research Assistant, Nuclear Materials Research Group}{Kingston,ON}
\item Designed a Sieverts Apparatus to gaseously charge hydrogen gas into zirconium alloys to mimic hydrogen embrittlement of zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors
\item The design is being implemented at Reactor Materials Testing Laboratory to test how hydrogen embrittled zirconium alloys respond in nuclear reactor conditions
\iffalse
\item Application to nuclear industry: zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors succumb to hydrogen embrittlement during its lifetime, therefore, it is important to be able to replicate the conditions in nuclear reactors, so as to study its end-of-life conditions
\fi
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{National University of Singapore}{Summer 2016}{Research Assistant, Centre for Advanced 2D Materials}{Singapore}
