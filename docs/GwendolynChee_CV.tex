\begin{rSubsection}{Queen's University at Kingston}{2016 - 2017}{Research Assistant, Nuclear Materials Research Group}{Kingston,ON}
Advisor: Professor Mark Daymond \\
Designed a Sieverts Apparatus to gaseously charge hydrogen gas into zirconium alloys to 
mimic hydrogen embrittlement of zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors.
\iffalse
The design is being implemented at Reactor Materials Testing Laboratory to test how hydrogen embrittled zirconium alloys respond in nuclear reactor conditions
 Application to nuclear industry: zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors succumb to hydrogen embrittlement during its lifetime, therefore, it is important to be able to replicate the conditions in nuclear reactors, so as to study its end-of-life conditions
